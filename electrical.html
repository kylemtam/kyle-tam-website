                    <p class="content-text text-left">Established in 2014, eleven-x is a fast-growing startup that enables small business and organizations to integrate low-power smart device solutions to optimize their profitability and efficiency. eleven-x works with multiple sectors such as cities, utilities and transportation to provide complete low power solutions that last more than 10 years with almost zero-maintenance using Canada's first and only coast-to-coast public LoRaWAN network.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">At my time at eleven-x, I worked as an IoT Device Technician on the Research & Development Team. My roles included conducting analysis of IoT sensors and devices from partner companies to gather data on the potential deployment for commercial applications and giving detailed reports of my findings and recommendatiosn to my supervisors. This included running tests in the office and creating jigs to replicate the harsh environmental conditions that the devices could expect to experience when deployed. In addition, I was deployed into the field to monitor sensor activity for clients and further customer relations through any desired device maintenance. </p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">Furthermore, I had the opportunity to work occasionally with the application side of the team where I coded back-end application scripts using PHP Laravel that decoded IoT device payloads and inputted the data into MySQL databases. I also worked with the team to create test cases that verified accurate payload decoding and data flow. </p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">As my responsibilities and tasks were conducted under the watch of multiple supervisors, I coordinated my progress with my team using applications such as Bitbucket and Jira.</p>

                    <p class="content-text text-left">Waterloo Rocketry is a design team from the University of Waterloo, composed of about 30 undergraduate students. Together, we research, design, acquire funding for, build, test, and launch high powered sounding rockets. Each year, the team competes in the Spaceport America Cup (SAC). SAC is the world's largest collegiate rocketry competition, attracting over 100 universities and colleges from over a dozen countries. In 2017 and 2018, Waterloo Rocketry took home first place in the 10,000-foot hybrid category. This past summer, our 18-foot-long rocket Shark of the Sky shot for 30,000 feet, culminating in a 2nd place finish.</p>

                    <p class="content-text text-left">In January, I joined the Data Acquisition Team where I have helped the team upgrade the hardware used to collect data on our rocket. During our cold flow and static fire tests of our engine, I work with the team to integrate load cells and differential pressure sensors in our setup to collect data on the performance of our engine. This was made possible using a custom program made on National Instrument's LabVIEW. Furthermore, I have helped the team test and troubleshoot PCBs created by our electrical team using KiCad and oscilloscopes to ensure that we collect accurate and complete data. This has also involved research into op-amps, power supplies and other components to conduct a noise analysis in order to figure out the source of the loss of data from our load cells.</p>

                    <p class="content-date">September 2018 - July 2019</p> 
                    <p class="content-text text-left">The Canadian Reduced Gravity Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-RGX) is a competition for Canadian post-secondary students to design and test a small scientific experiment on board a Falcon-20 which had been modified for reduced gravity flight to simulate the effects of microgravity. This competition was made possible through a collaboration with the National Research Council and the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">As a part of a team of 8 students in Waterloo Rocketry's Payload division, I helped design and test an experiment that aimed to characterize the physics of ferrofluids and collodial fluids under the influence of a magnetic field in simulated microgravity. This was done with the goal of determining the potential applications of ferrofluids in commercial applications for the space industry. On July 24, 2019, I had the amazing opportunity fly aboard the Falcon-20 to conduct our experiment as one of the primary mission specialists..</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">During our design cycle, we pursued the design and manufacturing of a solenoid-powered fluid system controlled by an STM32 Blue Pill and H-bridge as a potential space industry application for pumping liquid oxygen and satellite cooling systems without the use of moving mechanical components. This design consisted of a fluid-filled loop with a solenoid stack attached on one side. An identical loop without a pump was placed beside this loop to serve as a control. A flow meter was used to measure the flow rate of the fluid in the loop, and pressure sensors before and after the pump measured the pressure differential across the pump. It was discovered that this model would not be viable for commerical applications due to the low flow rates measured without the use of excessive power consumption in the system.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">My contributions to the electrical side of this project included refining and testing the code that output two SPWM waves offset by 90 degrees which were then converted to sine waves using the H-bridge. To produce SPWM, two PWM signals were generated on A0 and A1, with each being 90 degrees offset from the other. Both of these PWM signals only generate the positive half of the sine wave. In order to create the negative half of the sine wave, two additional pins A2 and A3 were alternated between 1 and 0 to encode the sign of the signal. This sign changed with every second SPWM wave to general the full sine curve. Variables are used to control the clock frequency and PWM frequency.
