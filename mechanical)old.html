                    <p class="content-text text-left">Flash Forest is Canada's first automated reforestation company that uses UAV technology, aerial mapping software and ecological science to regenerate ecosystems on a global scale. The use of drone-assisted reforestation reduces tree planting times from days to a matter of hours. This will accelerate the rate of reforestation worldwide, helping to restore entire ecosystems and scale up the global quest for carbon neutrality.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">During my time at Flash Forest, I had the opportunity to assist in the development of the company’s core seed pod technology. My primary responsibility was assisting in the establishment of a semi-automated manufacturing process for the company's proprietary seed pods that were previously produced by hand. This involved experimenting with different machinery and prototyping parts to integrate with commercial technologies.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">I also worked with full-time staff and other co-ops on the development of the company's seed pod distribution system. Mounted on drones, this system is used to precisely embed seed pods into the ground to maximize germination in various soil types around the world!</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">In parallel to my technical projects, I helped to standardize the company's documentation by introducing a concise format for all research and design reports used by the engineering team. I also made great efforts to keep all project pages updated in the company's internal wiki for future project continuation.</p>

                    <p class="content-text text-left">Waterloo Rocketry is a design team from the University of Waterloo, composed of about 30 undergraduate students. Together, we research, design, acquire funding for, build, test, and launch high powered sounding rockets. Each year, the team competes in the Spaceport America Cup (SAC). SAC is the world's largest collegiate rocketry competition, attracting over 100 universities and colleges from over a dozen countries. In 2017 and 2018, Waterloo Rocketry took home first place in the 10,000-foot hybrid category. This past summer, our 18-foot-long rocket Shark of the Sky shot for 30,000 feet, culminating in a 2nd place finish.</p>

                    <p class="content-date text-left" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Subteam Lead: August 2019 - Present</p> 
                    <p class="content-date text-left">Member: September 2018 - July 2019</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">I joined the Payload subteam back in September 2018 when I first joined the team. As the subteam I have spent the most time with, I have worked on numerous projects including the designing and manufacturing of the team’s 2019 payload. This experiment assessed the properties of 3D printed parts with varying infills and materials such as PLA and PET-G during the flight of our rocket. By weighing these parts down with steel and aluminum loads, we were able to conduct an analysis on the viability of integrating 3D printed parts into future iterations of our rocket. A practical application of 3D parts that we flew within the rocket was a biological capsule that housed berry seeds. This was flown to test the effects of hypergravity and microgravity on fruit seeds and experimental testing is still ongoing as the plants continue to mature.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">All of our payloads are flown in structures known as CubeSats. Manufactured primarily out of aluminum stock, these cubular containers are the standard used within the space industry to launch low-cost, low-weight satellites and rocket payloads. Some of the parts I designed and prototyped early on include an iteration of the systems module, the end-face, the side-plates and the supporting plates. You can find more info on the  <a href="http://www.cubesat.org/s/cds_rev13_final2.pdf">CubeSat specification here.</a></a></p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">Other projects I have worked on include the design of a 3D printed tablet case attachment to integrate a PCB onto a tablet for the use of ground crew and the design of multiple battery mounts.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">For the 2020/2021 competition, I have taken on the role of project lead for Payload. Currently we are working on an experiment that will be used to conduct a materials analysis of two types of materials: exotic conformal coating additives and boron-nitride nanotube (BNNT) composites. To do this, we are currently developing a set of radiation detectors and flight sensors to determine the characteristics of these materials, including whether these composites could be used as structural or protective materials to shield sensitive space hardware from cosmic radiation. In addition, I have been spending additional time working with the mechanical team to revamp our CubeSat design to simplify fabrication and make it more modular for future payloads. We have also been making efforts to learn the basics of ANSYS and FEA to conduct structural and vibrational analysis.</p>

                    <p class="content-text text-left">
                        In April 2019 I decided to join the Airframe subteam to gain experience in the design and manufacturing of the exterior of the rocket's structure. 
                        Since then, I have helped with the research, manufacturing, and assembly of our fibreglass nosecone and the team’s first carbon fibre fin can. 
                        I worked with the team in redesigning the fibreglass nosecone, selecting a Von Kármán shape and 4:1 fineness ratio to optimize the geometry for subsonic and transonic flight.
                        I also participated in the numerous late-night wet layups where we used epoxy, carbon fibre, fibreglass, an aluminum mandrel and a vacuum to manufacture our fin can. 
                        Joining this subteam has taught me a lot about the fabrication and applications of composites materials and I hope that the manufacturing of our body tubes next year will offer me more opportunities to learn more.

                        The recovery deployment mechanism in our rocket has always been one of the least developed subsystems within our rocket. 
                        That's why in April 2019 I decided to join the subteam along with a few first years with the goal of developing the team's first fully operational recovery deployment system. 
                        During my time with the subteam, I helped design and manufacture the electronics sled and integrate it onto the aluminum bulkhead within our fibreglass nosecone. This was a key component of the subsystem as the sled contained all the recovery electronics needed to deploy our drogue and main parachutes. 
                        The design was especially challenging as this section had been moved into the nosecone, reducing the available amount of free space dramatically while additional components had been added compared to the year before.

                        To verify a functional design, we conducted a mock parachute-deployment test in which we loaded the section with CO2 cannisters and simulated a recovery deployment explosion. 
                        In the end the recovery section succeeded in deploying our drogue parachute during descent, however it failed to deploy the main parachute. 
                        This failure was attributed to the faulty pyrocutters that failed to sever the cord that anchored the main parachute within its body tube.

                    <p class="content-date">September 2018 - July 2019</p> 
                    <p class="content-text text-left">The Canadian Reduced Gravity Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-RGX) is a competition for Canadian post-secondary students to design and test a small scientific experiment on board a Falcon-20 which had been modified for reduced gravity flight to simulate the effects of microgravity. This competition was made possible through a collaboration with the National Research Council and the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">As a part of a team of 8 students in Waterloo Rocketry's Payload division, I helped design and test an experiment that aimed to characterize the physics of ferrofluids and collodial fluids under the influence of a magnetic field in simulated microgravity. This was done with the goal of determining the potential applications of ferrofluids in commercial applications for the space industry. On July 24, 2019, I had the amazing opportunity fly aboard the Falcon-20 to conduct our experiment as one of the primary mission specialists.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">Our experiment consisted of multiple geometries of 2-dimensional containers positioned on the back wall of a Pelican Case that were partially filled with ferrofluid. On the front side of the case, there was a phone camera taking videos of the fluid which were analyzed post-experiment. Magnets were added around the experiment to allow us to precisely control the magnitude and direction of the external force being applied to the system. Since in microgravity the only force acting on a fluid is its surface tension, this allowed us to see how a fluid would react to itself and the container in which it was confined within. This made it possible for us to observe exactly how external forces affected factors like contact angle, droplet size and free-surface shape.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">My contributions to the mechanical side of this project included designing the back plate, base bracket and phone mount using Solidworks. These were machined using tools such as the vertical bandsaw and drill press provided by the University of Waterloo's Enginering Student Machine Shop. The scope of the mechanical aspect of the project had to be designed and constructued with the intent of accomplishing it in a budget of $300 and a timeline of two weeks due to a leadership change part way through the development cycle of the project.</p>

                            In the 2017, I joined up in a group of 4 students to participate in the Skills Ontario Robotics Compeition, a competition that challenges high school and college students in an engaging engineering contest to combine knowledge from various fields to design, fabricate and operate a robot.

                            Together, we built two telecommunicated pipeline-building robots that won 1st place at the DPCDSB Skills Ontario regional qualifying competition. 
                            By applying our knowledge of programming and circuity, we integrated Arduino and Vex components with our own claw and scoop designs powered by servos and DC motors to produce working robots under a limited budget.
