                            Working at Canadensys, my role centered around supporting the manufacture and testing of an engineering model and flight camera builds to be delivered to a commercial client. As a smaller aerospace company, I had the opportunity to get hands-on experience working with equipment bound for space. Work was conducted in conducting mechanical and electrical tests of the cameras including qualifying the PCBs and conducting thermal and vibrational tests at partner testing locations. Work was also conducted to consolidate past manufacturing experiences and create a streamlined manufacturing and testing process while adhering to the strict qualification and regulatory rules surrounding aerospace equipment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also had the opportunities to conduct some R&D work in advancing the company's knowledge in optical focusing and flat field testing. This was a result of discovering inconsistencies in the company's previous testing and calibration processes and developing workarounds to facilitate more accurate cameras builds in the future. Design work was also conducted in developing a test jig platform using SolidWorks to qualify camera lens focus degradation under low vacuum environments.

                            During my time at Flash Forest, I had the opportunity to assist in the development of the company’s core seed pod technology. This included establishing a semi-automated manufacturing process for the company's proprietary seed pods that were previously produced by hand, as well developing a drone-mounted embedding system rapid precise planting in various soil types around the world.

                        <p>
                            In parallel to my technical projects, I helped to standardize the company's documentation by introducing a concise format for all research and design reports used by the engineering team. I also made great efforts to keep all project pages updated in the company's internal wiki for future project continuation.

                            Flash Forest is Canada's first automated reforestation company that uses UAV technology, aerial mapping software and ecological science to regenerate ecosystems on a global scale. The use of drone-assisted reforestation reduces tree planting times from days to a matter of hours. This will accelerate the rate of reforestation worldwide, helping to restore entire ecosystems and scale up the global quest for carbon neutrality.

                            At eleven-x, I was introduced to IoT devices through my work conducting hardware analysis and verification of sensors. My job was to take commercial and in-house devices and determine how they could be integrated into the company's secure software platform to offer full-scale solutions for customers. This work included monitoring device performance over the company's LoRaWAN network and assembling test jigs to simulate product performance. Subsequent work included software tasks such as writing decoders using PHP Laravel to decipher device data in regular bi-weekly application releases.
