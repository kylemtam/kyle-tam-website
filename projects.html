                    <p class="content-text text-left">The Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing Lab is one of the largest research and development additive manufacturing facilities in the world, hosted at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The MSAM Lab focuses on next generation additive manufacturing processes. To this end, the lab explores novel techniques to develop advanced materials, innovative products, modeling and simulation tools, monitoring devices, closed-loop control systems, quality assurance algorithms and holistic in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">At my time at MSAM, I was contracted out to the lab's industrial partner Promation where I worked with a small group of researchers and engineers in the development of a 5-axis laser metal deposition 3D printer. Unlike traditional plastic FDM printers, this 3D printer uses high-power lasers, gas-fed powder feed, rotating build plate and a 5-axis industrial robot to manufacture metal objects with minimal supports in a short amount of time.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">A lot of the work I did on this project included the development of a machine vision-based data acquisition and control system in LabVIEW that was used to track layer height during production and correct for uneven layering. Other tasks included work on a laser scanning quality control system used to detect 5+ μm defects in prints, as well as working with my supervisor on improving process planning algorithms to create more efficient tool paths for the robot while not colliding with prints.</p>

                    </h1>
                    <p class="content-date">September 2018 - July 2019</p> 
                    <p class="content-text text-left">The Canadian Reduced Gravity Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-RGX) is a competition for Canadian post-secondary students to design and test a small scientific experiment on board a Falcon-20 which had been modified for reduced gravity flight to simulate the effects of microgravity. This competition was made possible through a collaboration with the National Research Council and the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">As a part of a team of 8 students in Waterloo Rocketry's Payload division, I helped design and test an experiment that aimed to characterize the physics of ferrofluids and collodial fluids under the influence of a magnetic field in simulated microgravity. This was done with the goal of determining the potential applications of ferrofluids in commercial applications for the space industry. On July 24, 2019, I had the amazing opportunity fly aboard the Falcon-20 to conduct our experiment as one of the primary mission specialists.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">Our experiment consisted of multiple geometries of 2-dimensional containers positioned on the back wall of a Pelican Case that were partially filled with ferrofluid. On the front side of the case, there was a phone camera taking videos of the fluid which were analyzed post-experiment. Magnets were added around the experiment to allow us to precisely control the magnitude and direction of the external force being applied to the system. Since in microgravity the only force acting on a fluid is its surface tension, this allowed us to see how a fluid would react to itself and the container in which it was confined within. This made it possible for us to observe exactly how external forces affected factors like contact angle, droplet size and free-surface shape. </p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">During our design cycle, we also pursued the design and manufacturing of a solenoid-powered fluid system controlled by an STM32 Blue Pill and H-bridge as a potential space industry application for pumping liquid oxygen and satellite cooling systems without the use of moving mechanical components. This design consisted of a loop of a circular fluid loop with a solenoid stack attached on one of the sides. An identical loop without a pump was placed beside this loop to serve as a control. A flow meter was used to measure the flow rate of the fluid in the loop, and pressure sensors before and after the pump measured the pressure differential across the pump. It was discovered that this model would not be viable for commerical applications due to the low flow rates measured without the use of excessive power consumption in the system.</p>

                        Since high school, I have been running a scientific news site called Newsoftheuniverse.com. 
                        This is a site where I share scientific discoveries, studies and breakthroughs that I have read online and transform them into densely-packed articles suitable for any audience. 
                        Eventually this side-project of mine expanded and it became a multi-school team project. 
                        Today, our team comprises of 20+ students from universities across the nation publishing articles in different fields in science including physics, engineering and the medical sciences.

                        Throughout this experience, I have made a lot of mistakes, resulting in personal failures like inconsistent postings and unmotivated volunteers. 
                        However, from these faults I have felt more inspired to improve upon my failures as a manager and a team member. 
                        This has resulted in better communication, more frequent company get-togethers and concise organization policies, all of which have benefited every member of the team.

                            On the day of the eclipse, I captured footage of the different phases of the eclipse as it progressed and also captured key events including Bailey’s Beads and solar flares. 
                            This data was later made available to the public by Google and UC Berkley which benefited scientists around the world who could use our database to further their research in solar science.
