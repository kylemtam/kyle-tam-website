                    <p class="content-text text-left">Waterloo Rocketry is a design team from the University of Waterloo, composed of about 30 undergraduate students. Together, we research, design, acquire funding for, build, test, and launch high powered sounding rockets. Each year, the team competes in the Spaceport America Cup (SAC). SAC is the world's largest collegiate rocketry competition, attracting over 100 universities and colleges from over a dozen countries. In 2017 and 2018, Waterloo Rocketry took home first place in the 10,000-foot hybrid category. This past summer, our 18-foot-long rocket Shark of the Sky shot for 30,000 feet, culminating in a 2nd place finish.</p>

                    <p class="content-date text-left">September 2018 - Present</p> 
                    <p class="content-text text-left">I joined the Payload subteam back in September 2018 when I first joined the team. As the subteam I have spent the most time with, I have worked on numerous projects including the designing and manufacturing of last year's payload that we flew aboard our rocket. Last year's experiment goal was to assess the properties of 3D printed parts with varying infills and materials such as PLA and PET-G during the flight of our rocket. By weighing these parts down with steel and aluminum loads, we were able to conduct an analysis on the viability of integrating 3D printed parts into future iterations of our rocket. A practical application of 3D parts that we flew within the rocket was a biological capsule that housed berry seeds. This was flown to test the effects of hypergravity and microgravity on fruit seeds and experimental testing is still ongoing as the plants continue to mature.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">All of our payloads are flown in metal containers known as CubeSats. Manufactured primarily out of aluminum stock, these cubular containers are the standard used within the space industry to launch low-cost, low-weight satellites and rocket payloads. Some of the parts I designed and prototyped include an iteration of the systems module, the end-face, the side-plates and the supporting plates. You can find more info on the CubeSat specification here: <a href="http://www.cubesat.org/s/cds_rev13_final2.pdf">http://www.cubesat.org/s/cds_rev13_final2.pdf</a></a></p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">Other projects I have worked on include the design of a 3D printed tablet case attachment to integrate a PCB onto a tablet for the use of ground crew and the design of multiple battery mounts.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">This coming year I will be leading the development of our next rocket's payload. This experiment is planned to contain two particle detectors that will be used to detect the presence of muons passing through the atmosphere. This will also act as a proof of concept for smaller, cheaper particle detectors that could be flown in CubeSats in low earth orbit or at high altitudes on sounding rockets.</p>

                    <p class="content-date text-left">April 2019 - Present</p> 
                    <p class="content-text text-left">
                            The recovery deployment mechanism in our rocket has always been one of the least developed subsystems within our rocket. 
                            That's why in April 2019 I decided to join the subteam along with a few first years with the goal of developing the team's first fully operational recovery deployment system. 
                            During my time with the subteam, I helped design and manufacture the electronics sled and integrate it onto the aluminum bulkhead within our fibreglass nosecone. This was a key component of the subsystem as the sled contained all the recovery electronics needed to deploy our drogue and main parachutes. 
                            The design was especially challenging as this section had been moved into the nosecone, reducing the available amount of free space dramatically while additional components had been added compared to the year before.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">
                            To verify a functional design, we conducted a mock parachute-deployment test in which we loaded the section with CO2 cannisters and simulated a recovery deployment explosion. 
                            In the end the recovery section succeeded in deploying our drogue parachute during descent, however it failed to deploy the main parachute. 
                            This failure was attributed to the faulty pyrocutters that failed to sever the cord that anchored the main parachute within its body tube.

                    <p class="content-text text-left">
                        In April 2019 I decided to join the Airframe subteam to gain a better idea at how the exterior sections of our rocket were built. 
During my time with this team, I helped with the manufacturing and assembly of our fibreglass nosecone and the teamâ€™s first carbon fibre fin can. 
I participated in the numerous late-night wet layups where we used epoxy, carbon fibre, fibreglass, an aluminum mandrel and a vacuum to manufacture our fin can. 
I also drafted a fibreboard aligning jig in AutoCAD that was laser-printed and used to secure the fins to the carbon-fibre body tube during epoxying. 
Joining this subteam has taught me a lot about the fabrication and applications of composites materials and I hope that the manufacturing of our body tubes next year will offer me more opportunities to learn more.

                    <p class="content-date">September 2018 - July 2019</p> 
                    <p class="content-text text-left">The Canadian Reduced Gravity Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-RGX) is a competition for Canadian post-secondary students to design and test a small scientific experiment on board a Falcon-20 which had been modified for reduced gravity flight to simulate the effects of microgravity. This competition was made possible through a collaboration with the National Research Council and the Canadian Space Agency.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">As a part of a team of 8 students in Waterloo Rocketry's Payload division, I helped design and test an experiment that aimed to characterize the physics of ferrofluids and collodial fluids under the influence of a magnetic field in simulated microgravity. This was done with the goal of determining the potential applications of ferrofluids in commercial applications for the space industry. On July 24, 2019, I had the amazing opportunity fly aboard the Falcon-20 to conduct our experiment as one of the primary mission specialists.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">Our experiment consisted of multiple geometries of 2-dimensional containers positioned on the back wall of a Pelican Case that were partially filled with ferrofluid. On the front side of the case, there was a phone camera taking videos of the fluid which were analyzed post-experiment. Magnets were added around the experiment to allow us to precisely control the magnitude and direction of the external force being applied to the system. Since in microgravity the only force acting on a fluid is its surface tension, this allowed us to see how a fluid would react to itself and the container in which it was confined within. This made it possible for us to observe exactly how external forces affected factors like contact angle, droplet size and free-surface shape.</p>
                    <p class="content-text text-left">My contributions to the mechanical side of this project included designing the back plate, base bracket and phone mount using Solidoworks. These were machined using tools such as the vertical bandsaw and drill press provided by the University of Waterloo's Enginering Student Machine Shop. The scope of the mechanical aspect of the project had to be designed and constructued with the intent of accomplishing it in a budget of $300 and a timeline of two weeks due to a leadership change part way through the development cycle of the project.</p>
