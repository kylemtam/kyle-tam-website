                        <p>
                            At TRIUMF, I worked on the conceptual and detailed design of a co-axial cavity test bed. This platform is designed to qualify all future cryomodules developed by TRIUMF for use in their particle accelerators and in accelerators around the world. Furthermore, this test bed would provide optimal conditions to conduct research on the performance of critical cryogenic, superconducting radiofrequency components used in particle accelerator components. This project was designed for conditions such as 10^-6 Pa vacuum, temperatures of 4°K, and consistent interaction with liquid helium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This job required working with senior members of the engineering staff in the SRF team to mature a conceptual design and bring it into detailed design. Working on CAD in SolidWorks, running simulations in ANSYS, conducting analysis following ASME standards, communicating with TRIUMF's in-house machine shop, and producing drawings using GD&T for manufacturing near the end of the term were also all required. Additional work was also conducted on the side developing an assembly frame to assist in the production of a 2200 kg cryomodule that TRIUMF's SRF team was developing for the CERN Hi-Lumi upgrade in Geneva.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            TRIUMF is Canada’s particle accelerator centre. From the hunt for the smallest particles in the universe to the development of new technologies, including next-generation batteries and medical isotopes, TRIUMF is pushing the frontiers in research to advance science, medicine, and industry.

                            Working at a global engineering consulting company, my time at Hatch exposed me to many exciting engineering challenges in the energy and mining industries. This was a great opportunity for me to develop core engineering skills in CAD modelling, engineer drawings, time studies, project cost analysis, and developing vendor relationships. Some projects where I provided assistance included:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li>the planning and design of a hydraulic unloader used to facilitate fuel extraction in the oil & gas industry</li>
                            <li>an early-stage design proposal for a large, high-speed bearing and damper system to be used in an experimental nuclear fusion reactor</li>
                            <li>a large capital cost estimate for a client's industrial steel furnace upgrade</li>
                            <li>collaborating with other co-ops to create a hand-held spring-loaded impactor device to conduct non-destructive testing of furnace refractory</li>
